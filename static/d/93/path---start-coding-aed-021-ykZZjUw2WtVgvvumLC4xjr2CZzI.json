So it makes sense to start this blog by outlining some prerequisite to learning to code.</p>\n<p>But before I do that, I want to clear some misconception that people tend to have about coding or learning how to code.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Codding is hard:</strong> People always have this misconception that coding is hard. This is hardly true. Coding can be as easy as learning a new language. Yes, you may find it intimidating at first, but with time it will be second nature to you.</li>\n<li><strong>You don’t need anyone to teach you:</strong> I have seen many people who say they want to learn how to code, but they don’t actually put in any effort in trying to learn how to code, they just sit an wait for someone to come and teach them or until they attend a computer science lecture. This is wrong. You can learn how to code on your own. Most professional developers today are self taught. This is not to say that you shouldn’t attend a computer science lecture or get a private tutor to teach you. Do that if you can, it may even help you learn faster. But in the case where you don’t have someone readily available to teach you or a computer science lecture to attend, don’t sit there and wait. Use the internet, there are numerous resources on there that may even teach you better than a private tutor would.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So now that is out of the way, lets talk about what you need to have in place to start coding right away.</p>\n<p>In truth, the only thing you need to start leaning how to code is and any device with Internet connectivity. It doesn’t matter if it is a mobile phone, a tablet, or a laptop, as long it have Internet access, you can use it to learn how code.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Requirements to start coding right away.","date":"January 01, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/start-coding/","previous":null,"next":null}}
